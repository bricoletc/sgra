Peptide inference from imperfect set of mass spec peaks by longest path construction

This is a C++ implementation addressing the following problem: knowing the mass of individual amino acids and given a set of mass
spectrometer derived peak intensities, infer the most likely peptide that gave rise to the peaks.

The problem is hosted at Project Rosalind: http://rosalind.info/problems/sgra/
